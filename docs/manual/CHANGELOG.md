## Release 1.0.2.0 (2024-09-05)

Documented a record of the CUDA APIs already available in SCALE, and those still to come: [Implemented APIs](./apis.md).

### Library Enhancements

- Kernel arguments larger than 4kb no longer crash the library.
- Programs that ignore CUDA error codes can no longer get stuck in a state
  where the library always returns the error code you ignored.
- Fixed synchronisation bugs when using synchronous `cuMemset*` APIs.
- Fixed implicit synchronisation behaviour of `cuMemcpy2D/cuMemcpy2DAsync()`.
- Fixed precision issues in fp16 `exp2()`, `rsqrt()`, and `h2log()`.
- `cudaEventRecord` for an empty event no longer returns a time in the past.
- Fixed occupancy API behaviour in edgecases that are not multiples of warp
  size.
- Fixed rare crashes during static de-initialisation when library wrappers
  were in use.
- All flags supported by SCALE's nvcc are now also accepted by our nvrtc
  implementation.
- Various small header fixes.

### Compiler Enhancements

- `decltype()` now works correctly for `__host__ __device__` functions.
- `-Winvalid-constexpr` no longer defaults to `-Werror`, for consistency
  with nvcc.
- PTX variable names including `%` are no longer rejected.
- Support for nvcc's nonstandard permissiveness surrounding missing
  `typename` keywords in dependent types.
- Support for nvcc's wacky "split declaration" syntax for `__host__ __device`
  functions (with a warning):
  ```
  int foo();
  __device__ int foo();
  __host__ int foo() {
      return 5;
  }
  // foo() is a __host__ __device__ function. :D
  ```
- Newly-supported compiler flags (all of which are aliases for
  standard flags, or combinations thereof):
    * `-device-c`
    * `-device-w`
    * `-pre-include`
    * `-library`
    * `-output-file`
    * `-define-macro`
    * `-undefine-macro`

### New CUDA APIs

#### Math APIs

- `exp10(__half)`
- `exp2(__half)`
- `rcp(__half)`
- `rint(__half)`
- `h2exp10(__half2)`
- `h2exp2(__half2)`
- `h2rcp(__half2)`
- `h2rint(__half2)`

## Release 1.0.1.0 (2024-07-24)

This release primarily fixes issues that prevent people from successfully
compiling their projects with SCALE. Many thanks to those users who
submitted bug reports.

### CUDA APIs

- The `extra` argument to `cuLaunchKernel` is now supported.
- Added support for some more undocumented NVIDIA headers.
- Fix various overload resolution issues with atomic APIs.
- Fix overload resolution issues with min/max.
- Added various undocumented macros to support projects that are explicitly
  checking cuda include guard macros.
- `lrint()` and `llrint()` no longer crash the compiler. :D
- Newly supported CUDA APIs:
    * `nvrtcGetNumSupportedArchs`
    * `nvrtcGetSupportedArchs`
    * `cudaLaunchKernelEx`, `cuLaunchKernelEx`, `cudaLaunchKernelExC`: some
     of the performance-hint
    launch options are no-ops.
    * `__vavgs2`, `__vavgs4`
    * All the `atomic*_block()` and `atomic*_system()` variants.

### Compiler

- Improved parsing of nvcc arguments:
     * Allow undocumented option variants (`-foo bar`, `--foo bar`,
       `--foo=bar`, and `-foo=bar` are always allowed, it seems).
     * Implement "interesting" quoting/escaping rules in nvcc arguments, such as
       embedded quotes and `\,`. We now correctly handle cursed arguments like:
       `'-Xcompiler=-Wl\,-O1' '-Xcompiler=-Wl\,-rpath\,/usr/lib,-Wl\,-rpath-link\,/usr/lib'`
- Support for more nvcc arguments:
    * NVCC-style diagnostic flags: `-Werror`, `-disable-warnings`, etc.
    * `--run`, `--run-args`
    * `-Xlinker`, `-linker-options`
    * `-no-exceptions`, `-noeh`
    * `-minimal`: no-op. Exact semantics are undocumented, and build times
      are reasonably fast anyway.
    * `-gen-opt-lto`, `-dlink-time-opt`, `-dlto`. No-ops: device LTO not yet
      supported.
    * `-t`, `--threads`, `-split-compile`: No-ops: they're flags for making
      compilation faster and are specific to how nvcc is implemented.
    * `-device-int128`: no-op: we always enable int128.
    * `-extra-device-vectorization`: no-op: vectorisation optimisations are
      controlled by the usual `-O*` flags.
    * `-entries`, `-source-in-ptx`, `-src-in-ptx`: no-ops: there is no PTX.
    * `-use-local-env`, `-idp`, `-ddp`, `-dp`, etc.: ignored since they are
      meaningless except on Windows.

- Allow variadic device functions in non-evaluated functions.
- Don't warn about implicit conversion from `cudaLaneMask_t` to `bool`.
- `__builtin_provable` no longer causes compiler crashes in `-O0`/`-O1` builds.
- Fixed a bug causing PTX `asm` blocks inside non-template, non-dependent
  member functions of template classes to sometimes not be compiled,
  causing PTX to end up in the AMD binary unmodified.
- CUDA launch tokens with spaces (ie.: `myKernel<< <1, 1>> >()`) are now
  supported.
- Building non-cuda C translation units with SCALE-nvcc now works.

### Other

- The `meson` build system no longer regards SCALE-nvcc as a "broken" compiler.
- `hsakmtsysinfo` no longer explodes if it doesn't like your GPU.
- New documentation pages.
- Published more details about thirdparty testing, including the build scripts.
